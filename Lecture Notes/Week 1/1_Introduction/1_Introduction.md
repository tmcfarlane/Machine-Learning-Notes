# What is Machine Learning?
Old: Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicity programmed.

New: Well-posed learning problem: A computer program is said to ***learn*** from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

P = performance
E = experience
T = task

Machine learning algorithms:
* Supervised
* Unsupervised

Others:
* Reinforcement learning
* Recommender systems
* etc

# Supervised Learning
**"Right" answers are given.**

We are given a data set and already know what our correct output should look like, noting a relationship between input and output.

Supervised learning is categorized into "regression" and "classification" problems.

* Regression: Predict continuous valued output
* Classification: Discrete valued output (0 or 1)

# Unsupervised Learning
**Answers are not given.**

Looking at data without any information as to a relationship in the data. The algorithm should find structure in the data without any help.

Examples:
* Given a set of news articles found on the web, group them into a set of artciles about the same story.
* Given a database of customer data, automatically discover market segments and group customers into market segments.
